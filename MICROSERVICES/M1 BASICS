Microservices is a software architecture in which an application is divided into small, loosely coupled services.

Microservices break a large application into small independent services that work together.

Microservices is for:
Big systems
Many users
Many developers

They communicate using HTTP APIs.

Microservices = multiple apps, not multiple classes.
