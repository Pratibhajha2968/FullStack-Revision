1. DataTypes :- DataTypes in java describe what type of data a variable can store.

 DataTypes are of two types :-
    1.Primitive DataTypes
       a.char
       b.long
       c.int 
       d.double
       e.float
       f.boolean
       g.short
       h.byte 
    2.Non Primitive DataTypes
        a.String
        b.array
        c.object
        d.interface
        e.class   


2.   Loops in java :-loops in java are used for iterating a number. We cant write each and everything again and again so we used loops.

   OR In technical word we can say loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly until the required condition is satisfied.

   Types of loops :-
       1. for loop 
          => used when number of counts are known.
          ex: for(i=0;i<=10;i++)
       2. foreach loop
          => it is the modern or enhanced loops which are used mostly .it is used in arrays and other methods.
          ex: int arr[] ={1,2,3,};
               for(int num : arr){
                  syso;
                  i++;
               }
       3. do-while loop
         => used for atleast one iteration
         ex: int i=6;
         do(
            syso;
            i++;
         )while(i<=8)
       4. while loop
           => used when number of counts are not known
          ex: int i=3;
          while(i<=5)
            syso;
            i++;
