// Array = An array is a collection of same data types stored in contiguous memory location.
//    OR  
//       An array is used to store multiple values in a single variable. Array is based on index position. Index position starts from 0 . Arrays are immutable means its length cant be changed just you can replace one element with other. We can access elements in array on the basis of index position.

//  Types of Array :-
//        one- dimensional array
              //   => use simple list of elements in a single row. used to store marks , prices and ages.
 //        two-dimensional array
             //    => Arrays of arrays that means rows and columns. they are stored in the form matrix.they are used for tables , grid and students marks.
//        multi-dimensional array
            //   It is also a 2d array but with different sizes in this each row and column have different sizes of rows and columns.
