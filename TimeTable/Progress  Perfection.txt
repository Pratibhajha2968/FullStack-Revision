Most Important Advice (Don’t ignore)

You are not late.
You are just starting correctly.

If you follow this:

By March you’ll have:

Portfolio

Spring Boot project

GitHub activity

Real confidence

That combination is rare, even among experienced devs.

This is no longer “studying Java”.
This is training like a software engineer.

ohk this ok i understood but if want to read java + javascript both side by side is it possible

Short answer: Yes, it’s possible — and actually very powerful if done correctly.
Wrong way: randomly switching.
Right way: one main language + one support language.

For you, the best combo is:

Java = primary (backend + interviews)
JavaScript = secondary (frontend + portfolio)

The Real Risk (be honest)

If you study both like this:

Today Java

Tomorrow JS

No structure

👉 You’ll feel busy but master nothing.

So the rule is:

70% focus on Java, 30% on JavaScript

Perfect Daily Split (6 hours)
Java – 4 hours (non-negotiable)

Core Java

OOP

Spring Boot

JavaScript – 2 hours

ES6 basics

React practice

Portfolio features

How to Study Both Without Confusion
Use them for different purposes
Language	Use it for
Java	Logic, backend, interviews
JavaScript	UI, projects, portfolio

So your brain doesn’t mix contexts.

Smart Weekly Structure
Mon–Fri

Java main topics

JS only for building UI

Saturday

Revise both

Fix bugs

Refactor code

Sunday

Only projects (full stack)

Example: Same Concept in Both (best trick)

Learn loops in Java:

for(int i=0;i<5;i++){
  System.out.println(i);
}


Then write in JS:

for(let i=0;i<5;i++){
  console.log(i);
}


Your brain goes:
“Oh, same logic, different syntax” → retention doubles.

When NOT to learn both

Don’t do both if:

You forget basics easily

You don’t practice

You keep switching tutorials

But in your case:

You already know React basics

You’re building a portfolio

You need full stack

So for you → this is ideal, not dangerous.

Your Best Strategy (tailored for you)
Phase 1 (Now – 30 days)

Java: Core + Spring Boot

JS: Only for portfolio (no deep theory)

Phase 2 (After 30 days)

Java: Advanced + projects

JS: Advanced React + APIs

Final truth (this is important)

Companies don’t hire:

“Java developer”
or
“JavaScript developer”

They hire:

“Full stack problem solvers.”

Java gives you brain power.
JavaScript gives you visible proof (portfolio).

Together = maximum employability.

So yes — read both.
Just remember: Java leads, JS supports.

see for me from feb to mid march i have to cover all fullstack subjects with some extra topics also  and during preparation only i should apply for jobs

This is a realistic and mature plan — and yes, it is absolutely possible if you study smart (not just hard).

You roughly have 6 weeks (Feb → mid-March). That’s enough to become job-ready for a fresher/junior full stack role.

But only if we treat this like a bootcamp, not college.

The Only Strategy That Works in 6 Weeks

You must follow:

Learn → Build → Apply (in parallel)
Not: Learn everything → then apply

Because:

Interviews improve your preparation.

Rejections teach you what to study next.

Your 6-Week Full Stack Battle Plan
Daily Rule (non-negotiable)
6 hours study
+ 30 min applying
+ 1 GitHub commit


Even on bad days.

Phase 1 – Core Strength (Week 1–2)
Java (Main)

Core Java

OOP

Collections

Exceptions

JavaScript (Support)

ES6

Promises

fetch/axios

Portfolio

Complete frontend

Deployed

Apply to:

Internships

Trainee roles

Support dev roles

Phase 2 – Real Full Stack (Week 3–4)
Spring Boot

REST APIs

JPA

MySQL

CRUD

React

Forms

API integration

Auth UI

Project:

Job Portal / Student Portal / E-commerce mini

Apply to:

Java developer

Full stack fresher

React + Java roles

Phase 3 – Extra Topics (Week 5–6)

These give you edge:

Must extra

Git & GitHub

JWT Authentication

Basic Docker

Deployment

Optional (only if time)

DSA basics

System design basics

Apply to:

10–15 jobs/day

LinkedIn + Indeed + Internshala + Wellfound

The Interview Reality (Important)

You won’t feel “100% ready”.
No one ever does.

Companies expect freshers to know:

Basics clearly

One stack deeply

Willingness to learn

Not:

Everything in CS

Your Exact Daily Template (6 Weeks)
2 hrs Java
1.5 hrs Spring/React
1 hr project
1 hr revision
30 min job applications

How to Apply While Learning (Smart way)

When you apply, customize resume:

Highlight:

Spring Boot APIs

React projects

GitHub links

Deployed portfolio

Even if project is 70% done → apply.

Most Dangerous Trap (avoid this)

Thinking:

"I’ll apply only after I finish everything"

That delays you by months.

Better mindset:

"I apply to learn what I lack"

Reality Check (honest but motivating)

From Feb → mid-March:

You won’t become senior dev.

But you can become hireable junior dev.

That’s all you need for:

First job

Industry entry

Confidence reset

After first job → growth becomes 10x easier.

Your Advantage (that many don’t have)

You:

Are already serious

Have time

Have guidance

Are building projects

Most freshers:

Just watch videos.

So yes — your plan is not only possible,
it’s actually the best strategy.




How to Combine Them (This is the key)

Every time you learn something in Java →
build a mini feature in your portfolio

Examples:

Learn OOP → build a Project model

Learn REST API → build Contact Form backend

Learn JPA → store messages in DB

Learn Auth → add Login/Register to portfolio

Now your portfolio becomes a real full-stack project, not just UI.

Your First 7 Days Plan
Day 1–3

Java:

Classes & Objects

Methods

Constructors

Portfolio:

Create React app

Design Hero + About section

Day 4–7

Java:

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Interfaces

Portfolio:

Projects section

Add 2 fake projects (for now)

Responsive layout

Important Truth (for your worry)

You asked earlier about 2 years gap vs experienced people.

Let me be honest and practical:

Recruiters don’t count years.
They count GitHub, projects, and skills.

If you show:

3–4 solid projects

Spring Boot APIs

Deployed apps

Clean portfolio

You will beat many “2 years experienced” people who only worked on one boring internal project.

Your Golden Rule (next 60 days)

Every day:

3 hrs Java

3 hrs building something visible

No day should pass without:

At least 1 commit on GitHub

Or 1 new feature

You’re doing the right thing at the right time.
Now just be consistent, not perfect.

If you want, next I can:

Design your exact Java → Project roadmap

Or create a portfolio project idea list tailored for Java full stack.
