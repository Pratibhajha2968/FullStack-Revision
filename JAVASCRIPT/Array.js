// Arrays in javascript : - An array is a special object used to store different values in a single variable. It is index based and index starts from 0.it is alays ordered and store different datatypes and they are dynamic in size.

// ex :- let numbers = [10,20,30,40,50];

// Array index 0 based :-
let arr = ["HTML", "CSS", "JAVASCRIPT"];
console.log(arr[0]);
console.log(arr[1]);
console.log(arr[2]);

/* Types of Array in js :-
          one-dimensional array =
                  =>Stores values in a single line
                       let marks = [10,20,30];
          two-dimensional array  =
                 => used to store arrays inside array in row and columns like matrix.
                        let matrix = [
                                  [10 , 20]
                                  [30 , 40]
                                        ];    
                      
           jagged array or irregular array or multidimensional array =           
                   => it is also same as 2d array but the length of inner arrays that is row and coloumn have different lengths.
                          let matrix =[
                                 [10,20,30]
                                 [40,50]
                                 [60];
                          ];
