/*
   States in React :- State  means data or condition of something that can change over a period of time.
               State refers to the values stored in variable at a particular time.


               int count = 0;   // state = 0
                 count = 5;    // state changed to 5

                 Here count is the state , first it was 0 then it changes to 5


    In react , state is a built in object used to store dynamic data that affects what is shown in the screen

            As states changes - UI also keeps on changing.


           1. count → current state value
           2. setCount() → updates the state
           3. Clicking button changes state → screen updates


        State is a data container that holds information about a component and controls its behavior and rendering. When the state changes, the UI updates automatically.
